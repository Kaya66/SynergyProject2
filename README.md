# Project Description

Our business resembled Target and we renamed it to BullsEye. In this project, the team was tasked with creating LWC's, Aura components, Apex Triggers, and Apex test classes. Each member created their own LWC that was then used by another member in an aura component. Each member created a trigger that is related to the business we chose to model. We then created our own unlocked packages that held our components and a metadata package containing all of the necessary metadata for all of the othe packages.
